# DataCraft
Web application for visualizing data from Minecraft (Blocks and recipes)

## Introduction

This is a Flask app that I made for a semester test, using Boostrap 3 and Flask module. It uses a database and data from a few differents websites. I learned a lot with this project : 
- How to use Bootstrap in general.
- Splitting HTML into differents parts like the header, or the footer.
- Flask itself and the modules.
- Parsing HTML files to get data (Images for example) using BeautifulSoup4.

## Requirements

To run this "webapp", you'll need Flask and all modules required inside the requirement.txt. Then you have to execute the script file run.sh and go to localhost:8000 in your browser

## How it works

Like most of Flask applications, there's a model-view-controller pattern. All templates are stored in the template folder, images and css are in the static folder.
